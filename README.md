## Description

Javascript 2D top-down game. This game uses es6 features to deliver a tile based map in an object oriented way. Uses the HTML5 canvas.

I wanted to see what I could do with just a HTML5 canvas and a bit of vanilla javascript. Still some work to do but it's a nice example of what can be done with simple tools and some .png images.
